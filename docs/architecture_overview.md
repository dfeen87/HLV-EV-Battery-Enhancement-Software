# HLV Battery Management System  
## Architecture Overview

**Version:** 1.0  
**Audience:** OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers, system architects, safety engineers  
**Scope:** Conceptual and software architecture (not hardware schematics)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document provides a **system-level overview** of the HLV Battery
Management System (BMS) architecture.

It explains:
- How data flows from hardware to decision-making
- How HLV physics integrates with conventional BMS logic
- Where OEMs plug in their own hardware, CAN stacks, and safety logic
- How the system scales from simple packs to multi-cell production packs

This document is intended to complement:
- Source code
- CAN mapping documentation
- OEM integration guides

---

## 2. Architectural Philosophy

The HLV BMS is designed around four core principles:

1. **Separation of concerns**  
   Physics, hardware access, safety, and vehicle control are cleanly separated.

2. **Fail-closed safety behavior**  
   Missing, stale, or invalid data always results in conservative behavior.

3. **Hardware agnosticism**  
   The core system does not assume any specific CAN stack, MCU, or BMS IC.

4. **Scalable fidelity**  
   The same architecture supports:
   - Simple pack-level estimation
   - Full multi-cell monitoring
   - Predictive health modeling

## 3. High-Level System Layers

The system is organized into five logical layers:

+--------------------------------------------------+
| Vehicle Systems |
| (Torque Control, Power Limits, UI, Telemetry) |
+-------------------------▲------------------------+
|
+-------------------------|------------------------+
| HLV BMS Middleware Layer |
| - HLVBMSMiddleware |
| - Diagnostics & Safety |
+-------------------------▲------------------------+
|
+-------------------------|------------------------+
| HLV Core & Advanced Models |
| - HLVEnhancement (physics-informed model) |
| - MultiCellPack / Health Prediction |
+-------------------------▲------------------------+
|
+-------------------------|------------------------+
| Hardware Adapter & Interfaces |
| - CAN decoding |
| - Sensor abstraction |
| - Actuator commands |
+-------------------------▲------------------------+
|
+-------------------------|------------------------+
| Physical Battery Hardware |
| - Cells, contactors, sensors, BMS ICs |
+--------------------------------------------------+

## 4. Hardware Abstraction Layer

### 4.1 Purpose

The hardware abstraction layer isolates **all platform-specific code**.

This includes:
- CAN drivers
- ADC / SPI / I2C access
- RTOS or OS timing services

The abstraction is defined by interfaces such as:
- `IPackSensors`
- `ICellSensors`
- `IBatteryActuators`
- `ITimeSource`

OEMs implement these interfaces using their preferred hardware stack.

---

### 4.2 Hardware Adapter

The reference `HLVHardwareAdapter` demonstrates:

- CAN-based pack telemetry ingestion
- Optional cell telemetry via SPI/I2C
- Stale data detection
- Conservative actuator control

This adapter is **intentionally incomplete** with respect to DBC specifics
and safety interlocks, allowing OEMs to integrate without vendor lock-in.

---

## 5. HLV Core Layer

### 5.1 HLVEnhancement (Core Physics)

At the heart of the system is the HLV physics-informed model, which augments
traditional BMS state estimation by incorporating:

- Energy flow coherence
- Entropy tracking
- Degradation dynamics
- Predictive confidence metrics

This layer operates on **pack-level signals only** and does not depend on
cell-level telemetry.

---

### 5.2 Advanced Models (Optional)

When enabled, advanced modules extend the system with:

- Multi-cell aggregation (`MultiCellPack`)
- Weak-cell detection
- Voltage imbalance analysis
- Long-horizon health forecasting
- Optional Kalman-based state filtering

These modules increase diagnostic resolution without changing the external API.

---

## 6. Middleware Layer

### 6.1 Role of the Middleware

`HLVBMSMiddleware` is the **integration contract** between physics,
hardware, and vehicle systems.

Its responsibilities include:
- Coordinating HLV core and advanced models
- Maintaining a stable enhanced state
- Producing deterministic diagnostics
- Enforcing safety constraints
- Providing a clean API to downstream systems

---

### 6.2 Outputs

The middleware produces:

- `EnhancedState`  
  Used by control systems (e.g., torque limiting)

- `DiagnosticReport`  
  Used by:
  - Dashboards
  - Telemetry
  - Safety supervisors
  - Maintenance tooling

These outputs are stable and intentionally conservative.

---

## 7. Vehicle Integration Layer

Downstream vehicle systems consume middleware outputs but do not modify them.

Typical integrations include:
- Torque and power limiting
- Regenerative braking constraints
- Driver feedback
- Fleet telemetry pipelines

Importantly, **vehicle control logic remains independent** of battery modeling.

---

## 8. Safety Model

Safety is enforced at multiple layers:

1. **Signal validation**  
   - Missing signals → fault  
   - Stale signals → fault  

2. **Physical limits**  
   - Voltage
   - Current
   - Temperature
   - SOC bounds  

3. **Degradation awareness**  
   - Health-based derating
   - Predictive warnings

The system is designed to **fail closed** and defer to higher-level safety
controllers when faults occur.

---

## 9. Scalability & Deployment Modes

The same architecture supports multiple deployment profiles:

| Mode               | Use Case                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Simple Mode        | Bench testing, simulations         |
| Multi-Cell Mode    | Production EV packs                |
| Advanced / ML Mode | Fleet learning & long-term analysis|

No API changes are required between modes.

---

## 10. What This Architecture Is Not

To avoid ambiguity, this system is **not**:
- A replacement for certified safety controllers
- A full vehicle control system
- A hardware-specific BMS firmware

It is a **physics-informed enhancement and integration layer**.

---

## 11. Summary

The HLV BMS architecture provides:

- A clean separation between hardware and intelligence
- Deterministic, safety-first behavior
- Scalable diagnostic depth
- OEM-friendly integration points

It is designed to be **understandable, auditable, and adaptable** across
manufacturers and platforms.
