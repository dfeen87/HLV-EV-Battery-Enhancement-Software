# HLV BMS – OEM Quick Start Guide

**Audience:** OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers, BMS / ECU integration teams  
**Goal:** Bring HLV BMS Middleware online with real hardware as quickly and safely as possible

---

## 1. What You Are Integrating

The HLV BMS Middleware is a **physics-informed enhancement layer** that sits
*above* hardware drivers and *below* vehicle control logic.

It does **not** replace:
- Your certified safety controller
- Your contactor interlock logic
- Your inverter control firmware

It **does** provide:
- Advanced state estimation
- Degradation awareness
- Weak-cell and imbalance detection
- Predictive diagnostics
- Deterministic safety gating

## 2. Minimal Integration Checklist (15–30 minutes)

To run HLV middleware on real hardware, you must implement **only one thing**:

### ✅ A hardware adapter that supplies pack telemetry

Specifically, you must provide implementations for:

- `IPackSensors`
  - Pack voltage (V)
  - Pack current (A, signed)
  - Pack temperature (°C)
  - State of charge (% or normalized)

Optionally:
- `ICellSensors` (for cell-level telemetry)
- `IBatteryActuators` (for contactors / balancing)
- `ITimeSource` (for system time)

A production-lean reference adapter is provided:

src/hlv_bms_hardware_adapter.hpp


Most OEMs adapt this file rather than starting from scratch.

---

## 3. CAN Integration (Typical Path)

### Step 1 – Map your DBC
Edit `OEMSignalMap` in the hardware adapter:
- Replace CAN IDs with your DBC values
- Verify scaling and sign conventions
- Confirm endianness

docs/oem_can_mapping.md

### Step 2 – Implement ICANTransport
Provide a thin wrapper around your existing CAN stack:
- SocketCAN (Linux)
- Vector / Kvaser / PEAK
- Embedded RTOS driver

Only two functions are required:
```cpp
bool send(const CANFrame&);
std::optional<CANFrame> receive();

Step 3 – Poll and Update

In your ECU/BMS main loop (or CAN thread):

adapter.set_now_seconds(t);
adapter.poll_can();
adapter.refresh_cells_from_backend(); // if applicable

4. Connecting to the Middleware

Once telemetry is available, integration is straightforward:

auto voltage = adapter.read_pack_voltage();
auto current = adapter.read_pack_current();
auto temp    = adapter.read_pack_temperature();
auto soc     = adapter.estimate_soc();

auto enhanced = bms.enhance_cycle(
    voltage, current, temp, soc, dt
);

Diagnostics are always available:

const auto& diag = bms.get_diagnostics();

5. Safety Expectations

The middleware enforces fail-closed behavior:

Missing signals → fault

Stale signals → fault

Out-of-range values → fault

On fault:

Control outputs should be derated or disabled

Higher-level safety controllers take precedence

HLV middleware never overrides OEM safety logic.

6. Optional Enhancements (Later)

After basic integration, OEMs may enable:

Multi-cell monitoring

Weak-cell detection

Voltage imbalance alerts

Health forecasting

Fleet telemetry

Kalman-filtered state estimation

All are optional and require no API changes.

7. Validation Before Deployment

Before field use, OEMs should verify:

 Signal freshness under load

 Fault behavior on signal loss

 Scaling correctness

 Temperature edge cases

 Degraded pack scenarios

 Safe interaction with torque / power limits
